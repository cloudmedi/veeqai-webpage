      "q1": "What are credits and how do they work?",
      "a1": "Credits are our usage-based currency. Each AI feature consumes credits: Text-to-Speech uses 1 credit per character, Music Generation uses 200 credits per 30 seconds, Voice Cloning uses 2,000 credits to create a voice model, and Voice Isolator uses 100 credits per minute.",
      "q2": "Do unused credits roll over to the next month?",
      "a2": "Yes! Unused credits automatically roll over to the next billing cycle. You can accumulate up to 3 months worth of credits, giving you flexibility in how you use VeeqAI.",
      "q3": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
      "a3": "Absolutely! You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. Your plan will remain active until the end of your current billing period, and you'll keep all unused credits.",
      "q4": "What's the difference between monthly and yearly billing?",
      "a4": "Yearly billing gives you a 17% discount (equivalent to 2 months free) and is billed once per year. Monthly billing is charged every month. Both options include the same features and credit allocations.",
      "q5": "Do you offer refunds?",
      "a5": "We offer a 14-day money-back guarantee for all paid plans. If you're not satisfied with VeeqAI within the first 14 days, contact our support team for a full refund.",
      "q6": "Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?",
      "a6": "Yes, you can change your plan at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately with prorated billing. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.",
      "q7": "Is there an API available?",
      "a7": "Yes! API access is available starting from the Starter plan. The Professional plan includes dedicated endpoints and higher rate limits for enterprise applications.",
      "q8": "Do you offer enterprise solutions?",
      "a8": "Yes, we offer custom enterprise solutions for large organizations. This includes custom pricing, SLA guarantees, SSO support, and dedicated account management."
